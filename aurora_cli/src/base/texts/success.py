You should update your ~/.bashrc to include export:

Add alias for convenience:

    <blue>alias aurora_psdk={path}/sdks/aurora_psdk/sdk-chroot</blue>

After that run the command:

    <blue>source ~/.bashrc</blue>

You can check the installation with the command:

    <blue>aurora_psdk sdk-assistant list</blue>

The files have been downloaded to the ~/Downloads folder, if you don't need them more, delete them.
